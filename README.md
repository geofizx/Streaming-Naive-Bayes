#Machine Learning, Function Approximation, and Signal Processing Libraries

This is my personal repository and includes Python implementations of algorithms I find interesting and useful for certain
problems in function approximation, signal processing, and machine learning.

In most cases, I have implemented algorithms that are not readily available through other open source libraries. In other
cases, the algorithms may be well known, but I have implemented them in a different way (e.g., streaming, adaptively, or
memory efficiently). In this sense, I am hopeful the code will be of use to some people.

Below is a list of the classes and methods contained in this repo along with a brief description of the algorithms.
